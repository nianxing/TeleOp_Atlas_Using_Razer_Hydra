# Telemanipulation_Atlas_Using_Razer_Hydra

This is a program for leisure apart from our preparation for DRC Final 2015,,, I had bring it to the DRC Expo for exibition of HKU Engineering Department with Razer Hydra and Oculus Rift ==

This package's function is using razer hydra to specify and publish position command to moveit and observe the movement in rviz and make the robot move. 

To get this small code work, you should first have ros and rviz, you should also have moveit in your computer, then add razer hydra plugin, 3d cursor plugin and oculus plugin in rviz which you can get them easily from synapic,, 

As for moveit, you can just use the default package, myself applied trajopt library and made it as a plugin for moveit.

The code is mainly contributed by Nian Xing and Chris Swetenham, hope it may provide you a little help.

For more details you can contact Nian Xing with email address : nianxing@connect.hku.hk
