# Tele-operate Atlas Using Razer Hydra

This is a demo for HKU robotics booth on DRC Expo 2015.

This package's function is using razer hydra to specify and publish position command to moveit and observe the movement in rviz. 

To get this small code work, you should first have ros and rviz, you should also have moveit in your computer, then add razer hydra plugin, 3d cursor plugin and oculus plugin in rviz.

As for moveit, you can just use the default package, myself applied trajopt library and made it as a plugin for moveit.

The code is mainly contributed by Cindy Nian and Chris Swetenham.

For more details you can contact Cindy with email address : nianxing AT connect.hku.hk
